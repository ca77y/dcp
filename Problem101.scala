/**
  * Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.
  * 
  * A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.
  * 
  * Example:
  * 
  * If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.
  * 
  * If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then
  * 
  * If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.
