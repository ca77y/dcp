/**
  * This problem was asked by Amazon.
  * 
  * Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple texts such that each text has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.
  * 
  * You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.
  * 
  * For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.
